Code Structure
The application is built using C# and Windows Forms. The weather information is retrieved using the OpenWeatherMap API, and the response is deserialized into C# objects using the Newtonsoft.Json library.

The code is organized into two main files:

weatherinfo.cs: Contains C# classes representing the structure of the JSON response from the OpenWeatherMap API.

btn.cs: The main form of the application, which handles the UI interactions and weather information retrieval. The getWeather method is responsible for making API requests and updating the UI with the fetched data.

External Libraries Used
Newtonsoft.Json: Used for deserializing JSON responses from the OpenWeatherMap API.
